Game of Life & Animation Project
This repository contains two Java programs developed as part of a first-year Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in Computer Science. The programs demonstrate fundamental OOP concepts through graphical user interface (GUI) components and animations.

Project Overview
AnimationPanel: A simple animation of a bouncing circle that moves horizontally across the window. The animation speed can be controlled using GUI buttons to start, stop, speed up, or slow down the movement.

Game of Life (GOL): An implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the life cycle of cells on a grid. Users can manually set up initial cell configurations, run the simulation step-by-step or continuously, and control the speed of the simulation.

Features
1. AnimationPanel
Start/Stop Animation: Start and stop the horizontal movement of the circle.
Control Speed: Increase or decrease the speed of the circle's movement.
Collision Detection: The circle bounces back when it hits the window edges.
2. Game of Life (GOL)
Customizable Grid: Users can toggle cells alive or dead by clicking on the grid.
Next Generation: Progress the simulation by one generation with a button click.
Automated Simulation: Start and stop continuous simulation with adjustable speed.
Generation Tracking: Displays the current number of generations that have passed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run these programs, you need:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with Java support
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Kareemnat12/GameOfLife.git
cd GameOfLife
Compile the Java Files: Navigate to the directory where the Java files are located and compile them using:

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
Run the Programs:

To Run AnimationPanel:
bash
Copy code
java AnimationPanel
To Run Game of Life:

java Main
Usage
AnimationPanel:

Open the window and use the buttons at the bottom to control the animation of the circle.
Game of Life:

Use the grid to set up initial live cells.
Use the "Next" button to advance the simulation step-by-step.
Use the "Go" button to run the simulation continuously.
Use "Clear" to reset the grid and "Faster" or "Slower" to adjust the speed.
Project Structure
AnimationPanel.java: Contains the code for the simple circle animation.
GOLMatrix.java: Contains the logic for the Game of Life matrix and cell operations.
GOLMatrixTester.java: A tester class for validating the Game of Life logic.
GOLPanel.java: Contains the GUI implementation for the Game of Life.
Main.java: The main class to run the Game of Life GUI application.
Learning Objectives
This project was designed to teach the following OOP principles:

Encapsulation: Using private fields and public methods to control access to object data.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Building a cohesive, flexible design.
Event-Driven Programming: Using Java Swing for creating GUI components and handling user actions.
Modularity: Organizing code into reusable classes and methods.
